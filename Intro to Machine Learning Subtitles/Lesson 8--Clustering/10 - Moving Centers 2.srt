1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,020
And then argue this is the one that minimizes it.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,700
In fact, a set of summary over here minimizes the total of

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,880
events in the bottom case.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,340
And we can argue where exactly it falls, but you get the principle
